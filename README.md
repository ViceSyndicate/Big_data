trim_data.py trims off some data in the .csv files and saves them.

pant_size_estimator.py uses my own k_nearestneighbour algorithm to estimate pant-size for both males and females using hip & waist circumference.

my_male_shirt_estimator.py uses my own k_nearestneighbour algorithm to estimate shirt-size males using weight & height.

main.py uses sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier to estimate shirt-size males using weight & height.
